### Preface

As a programmer intrigued by Unreal Engine and its inner workings, I come from a background in Software Systems Engineering. I highly value approaching learning at a deeper level and documenting insights for my future self.

Why did I write this? At some point during the development of C++ gameplay systems in Unreal Engine, I found myself frequently revisiting the UObject system. Whether breaking things or navigating through code in the debugger, the memory layout of UClass puzzled me, leaving me to wonder how it functioned. My initial C++ knowledge wasn't robust enough to confidently reverse engineer the entire system independently, so I turned to other developers with questions about reflection or the UObject system. Unfortunately, in many cases, the answers lacked the depth I sought, leading to responses like "Trust me, bro," with the consensus being that you write it that way because.

Like any developer facing a challenge, I embarked on a serious search, but there weren't many in-depth articles on the Unreal Engine Reflection system from this side of the ocean (North America). That's when I stumbled upon Dazhao's articles, which form the foundation of this document. I made some adjustments, updates, and additions from other articles I found to complement this topic. The catch was that the articles were written in Chinese, so I undertook the task of translating them over an extended period, meticulously verifying the content by experimenting with the concepts outlined in Dazhao's articles. I realized that I had stumbled upon a wealth of deep knowledge about the topic, and along the way, I learned more C++ concepts. So, it required some additional learning on the side to gain a better understanding of how the system works. This document was written for my future self as a way to solidify what I learned about this complex system. Additionally, writing this served as an exercise to keep track of my learning progress on the topic. Therefore, those whose work I cite at the end, I am deeply grateful for helping me improve as a programmer. 'Sharing is Caring,' so I want this information out in the world for people to reference it and hope to find it as a helpful resource they can use when building their systems.
#### Requirements

- An intermediate level of C++ is necessary to comprehend the concepts presented in this document. When I began, I possessed just enough C++ knowledge but found it beneficial to review some lower-level aspects along the way to grasp certain tricks employed with the language. As you progress through the reading process, you may discover and learn additional C++ tricks.
- I strongly recommend downloading the engine source code. This is crucial for inserting if statements in scenarios where you can set breakpoints for a specific step in the reflection process.
- Towards the end, there is sample code practical code. I encourage you to engage with this code actively, as there is no better substitute for hands-on experience after studying such a comprehensive topic.
